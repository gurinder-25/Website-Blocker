# Website Blocker Interface with Tkinter

This Python program utilizes the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface for a website blocker tool. The application allows users to specify websites they want to block by adding their URLs in a text entry field, separated by commas. Upon clicking the "Block" button, the program updates the system's hosts file to redirect those websites to the localhost (127.0.0.1), effectively blocking them.
