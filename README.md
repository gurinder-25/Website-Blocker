# Website Blocker Interface with Tkinter

This Python program utilizes the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface for a website blocker tool. The application allows users to specify websites they want to block by adding their URLs in a text entry field, separated by commas. Upon clicking the "Block" button, the program updates the system's hosts file to redirect those websites to the localhost (127.0.0.1), effectively blocking them.

Key Features:

Utilizes Tkinter for building the graphical user interface.
Implements a dark theme UI with customized styles.
Provides an input field for users to enter website URLs they want to block.
Parses the input and updates the system's hosts file to block specified websites.
Informs the user about the blocking status through a result label.
Supports resizable window dimensions for better user experience.
This program offers a straightforward way to block access to specific websites on a local system and can be a useful tool for managing internet usage.
